# Objective

Brainstorm is a web application that serves as a way for groups of people to collaborate and come up with ideas for projects of any kind. Users can send text to one another like in any chat room, but with the added option of conducting brainstorming sessions whenever they want. Brainstorming sessions allow chat members to contribute ideas, critique them, and take a vote to preserve the ideas they like the most. The ultimate goal of Brainstorm is to provide a virtual platform that makes brainstorming fast, easy, and fun for all.
